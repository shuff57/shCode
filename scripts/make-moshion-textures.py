"""Slice moSHion's built-in texture catalog out of Kenney's Pixel Redux sheet.

`sprite.texture = 'crate'` resolves a NAME, not a URL. The names below are the
whole catalog: each one is a 21x21 tile cut from the packed tilemap that ships
in scripts/assets/kenney-pixel-redux/.

Provenance, because this repo has been burned once already (see
public/moshion/docs/LICENSE.md section 4 -- the assets/ directory held art
byte-identical to q5play's while the license claimed it as original work):

  Pack     Kenney, "Platformer Art: Pixel Redux", created 2020-04-22
  License  CC0 1.0 Universal -- the pack's own License.txt says "free to use
           in personal, educational and commercial projects"
  Source   github.com/ETdoFresh/kenney.nl/platformerart_pixelredux_2
  Sheet    Tilemap/tilemap_packed.png, sha256 883071fc...99bdc78, 630x630
  Layout   30x30 grid of 21x21 tiles, row-major; tile index N is at
           (N % 30, N // 30). Verified against the pack's own Tiles/tile_NNNN.png
           -- tile_0000.png is byte-identical to the slice at index 0.

Nothing here is redrawn or modified: each output PNG is an exact crop. CC0
imposes no attribution requirement, but the pack's License.txt is vendored
beside the sheet anyway so the provenance travels with the bytes.

Adding a texture: add a name -> tile index below and re-run. To find an index,
crop the sheet with a labelled grid -- index = row * 30 + col.
