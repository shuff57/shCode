 * it descends from, hollowing the shape AS IT CURRENTLY LOOKS is exactly the
 * case occt-build.ts's own 'shell' branch refuses -- "this kernel cannot
 * hollow a shape that already has a hole or a round" is a real numerical
 * limit of the offset-then-cut it runs, not a data-model rule this file
 * enforces. But which shape gets shelled is a MODELLING CHOICE, not a fact
 * about the geometry: shelling the ORIGINAL primitive, before that hole or
 * round ever cut it, produces exactly the part a student meant (a hollowed
 * box that still has its hole and its round) and hits none of that limit,
 * because it never touches a hole-or-rounded shape at all.
 *
 * Walks the picked feature's `target` chain back to its root (a primitive,
 * or anything with no `target` field), and returns:
 *  - `target`: what the new Shell should actually target -- the picked
 *    feature itself when nothing in its ancestry is a hole or a round, or
 *    the first ancestor found BEFORE the first hole/round otherwise.
 *  - `insertAt`: the array index to splice the new feature in at -- the
 *    end of the document in the ordinary case, or immediately after
 *    `target`'s own position when reordering.
 *  - `rewireId`: null in the ordinary case, or the id of the first
 *    hole/round in the chain -- the caller must repoint THAT feature's own
 *    `target` at the new Shell's id once it exists, so the rest of the chain
 *    (everything already built from it) keeps building on top of the shell
 *    instead of on the bare primitive.
 *
 * A combine's plural `targets` is not walked -- this only ever needs to
 * cross the single-`target` chain a Hole/Fillet/Extrude/Revolve/Shell/Move
 * already forms, and a Combine sitting in that ancestry is treated as a root
 * (a reasonable stopping point, not a claim that nothing beyond it matters).
 *
 * THE FORWARD CASE, added after the backward-only version shipped a real
 * double-body bug: a face pick resolves to whichever feature OWNS that
 * face (see ownerOf()/nameFaceOnCurrentShape()), which can be an upstream
 * ROOT even after later features built on top of it -- a Hole, a Round on
 * some other edge, neither of which touched the picked face at all. Picking
 * a box's own top face after Box -> Hole -> Round used to pass the box's
 * own id as `pickedId` with NOTHING in its backward ancestry (a primitive
 * has no `target`), so this returned "append at the end, no reorder" --
 * and the Hollow that got appended targeted the box DIRECTLY, leaving Hole
 * and Round dangling off the ORIGINAL box in their own untouched branch.
 * `topLevel()` then had two unconsumed leaves (the Hole/Round chain's own
 * tip, and the new Hollow) and rendered BOTH, overlapping, as if the model
 * had silently forked in two. Checked as a single direct hop, not a further
 * walk down the whole downstream chain: reordering past anything ELSE
 * requires rewiring THAT feature's own `target`, and rewiring a feature
 * that is not itself the blocker would silently drop whatever it does (a
 * Move in between, say) -- so this only ever reorders past a blocker that
 * targets the picked feature directly, the same one-hop case the backward
 * walk above already only ever rewires.
