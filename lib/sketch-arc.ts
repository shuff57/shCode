 * Rounds asked for on the DESIGN corners, and the outline they add up to.

 *
 * A sketch stores only what the student placed -- its corners, and a radius on
 * the corners they rounded -- and outlineOf() is the only code that may produce
 * or read an arc's endpoint, so no mover can hold, move, or invalidate a point
 * it did not create.
 *
 * That sentence is the whole design. Before it, a fillet baked its two trim
 * points straight into f.points, where they were indistinguishable from
 * corners the student had drawn -- so the drag handles offered one per trim
 * point, the constraint solver relaxed them like any other corner, and the
 * Rules panel listed the arc as an edge. Each of those moved a trim point
 * while the bulge factor beside it stayed put, and a bulge is a factor of ITS
 * OWN CHORD: same factor, shorter chord, smaller radius, broken tangency, no
 * error anywhere. Measured: dragging one trim point of an r=8 fillet took the
 * radius to 28.15 and opened a 33.4-degree kink at the joint; one length rule
 * on the STRAIGHT edge next door took it to 6.32 in the same click that
 * created it. Refusing each mover one at a time is a losing game -- there is
 * always a fourth. Taking the points away from them is not.
 *
 * `basis` says which design corner each outline point came from, which is what
 * lets the overlay project a derived point through a real anchor: both trim
 * points of corner k carry basis k.
 *
 * `ok: false` means the DESIGN has collapsed -- two corners on top of each
 * other, so an edge has no length and the outline has stopped being a shape.
 * Callers keep whatever they had rather than adopting it (see solveDoc()).
 * The message names no remedy on purpose: this is reached from the constraint
 * solver, from a drag and from a load, and only one of those has something to
 * undo. The caller that knows which one it is adds the remedy.
