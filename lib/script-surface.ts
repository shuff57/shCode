// The scripting surface, and what survives the kernel swap.
//
// reSHape has two halves. The MODELLER is a ModelDoc built by clicking, and
// lib/occt-build.ts already carries it onto a B-rep kernel. The other half is
// the one a student TYPES -- the names in scope inside main(), documented across
// lib/reshape-docs.ts and public/reshape/docs/reference.md. That half is what
// this file is about, and until now nobody had counted it.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-02, and the counting is the point:
//
//   183 documented pages carry a runnable code example
//    75 distinct API names are called across them
//   166 of the 183 (90.7%) use only names a B-rep kernel can serve
//    17 do not, and they split into two groups that need completely
//       different things done about them
//
// The two groups look identical from the outside -- "this name does not work on
// the new kernel" -- and are not the same problem at all:
//
//   ABSENT   OpenCascade does not have the operation, in ANY build. `hull` is
//            the whole of this group among the primitives: of the 498 exports in
//            the replicad OpenCascade build, ZERO match /hull/i, and OCCT ships
//            no convex hull algorithm to bind. Nothing to go and enable. Either
//            we own it or the eleven pages stop working, which is why
//            lib/hull.ts exists.
//
//   UNBOUND  OpenCascade HAS the operation and this particular wasm build does
//            not expose it. Non-uniform scale is the group: `gp_GTrsf` is bound
//            (the 3x3 that stretches unequally) but `BRepBuilderAPI_GTransform`,
//            the only thing that applies one to a shape, is not, and
//            `BRepBuilderAPI_Transform` takes only a `gp_Trsf`, whose sole
//            scaling method is `SetScale` -- one factor, all three axes. So
//            `scale([2, 2, 2], s)` works and `scale([3, 1, 1], s)` has no path.
//            Fixed by rebuilding the binding list, not by writing geometry.
//
// THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MISSED. Nobody would have predicted `scale`. It
// is the most ordinary transform in the vocabulary and it reads as obviously
// portable; the docs page for it is titled "scale: bigger, smaller, squashed"
// and its taught line is `scale([3, 1, 1], shape)` -- "which is how a circle
// becomes an oval". The squashed third of that title is the part with no path.
// It surfaced only because every name was checked against the actual export
// list rather than against a reading of what OpenCascade "obviously" supports.
//
// THIS FILE HOLDS NO GEOMETRY AND IMPORTS NO KERNEL, deliberately -- the same
// split as lib/topo-name.ts against lib/topo-resolve.ts. A verdict about which
// operations exist is a question about the two libraries, answerable while
// designing and checkable in a suite that has no wasm to load.
//
// HOW A VERDICT STAYS HONEST. Each entry names the OpenCascade export its
// verdict rests on, and scripts/test-occt-adapter.mjs asserts presence for every
// name claimed present AND absence for every name claimed missing. A claim of
// absence that would never notice becoming false is not a measurement -- so if a
// future build binds GTransform, the suite goes red and `scale` gets re-judged
// rather than staying refused out of habit.
