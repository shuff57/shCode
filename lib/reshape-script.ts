// reSHape Script -- the scripting side of the B-rep build. See
// .gauntlet/SPEC-reshape-script.md for the language this file implements.
//
// THE ONE IDEA (repeated from the spec, because it is the whole design): a
// reSHape script is the Build timeline written down. Every call below appends
// one step to the same ModelDoc the Build tools produce (lib/model-types.ts),
// using the SAME `new*` constructors and the SAME `nextId()` sequence a mouse
// click would use, so a script and a sequence of toolbar clicks that "mean
// the same thing" produce byte-comparable docs. There is no second geometry
// representation here -- runScript() never touches a kernel, never emits
// JSCAD or OpenCascade calls, and never draws anything. It only builds a
// ModelDoc and a parameter list; lib/occt-build.ts is what turns that into a
// solid, exactly as it already does for a doc the mouse built.
//
// WHY new Function() AND NOT eval(). Two reasons, both load-bearing. First,
// this file has to run identically in two hosts: a plain Node process
// (scripts/test-reshape-script.mjs, no DOM) and a sandboxed iframe compiled
// through scripts/build-brep-kernel.mjs (public/reshape/script-runner.html).
// eval() inside a module (this file compiles to one) is always the "indirect
// eval" form when called as `(0, eval)(...)`, or inherits strict mode from
// its caller otherwise -- new Function() sidesteps that ambiguity by always
// producing an ordinary, non-strict function body, matching the JSCAD runners'
// choice of a real <script> tag for the same reason (see runner.html's own
// comment on this). Second, a Function body appended with a `//# sourceURL=`
// comment gets its OWN name in a stack trace in both V8-based hosts (Node and
// Chromium), which is what makes error line numbers possible below without a
// parser of our own -- see lineOf().
//
// THE LINE-NUMBER OFFSET IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. `new Function(a, b, body)`
// synthesizes `function anonymous(a,b\n) {\n<body>\n}`, so V8 reports every
// line inside <body> two lines higher than it actually sits. Measured
// directly against this exact construction (see the shell session that
// produced this file): a `throw` on body line 3 is reported at line 5,
// regardless of how many parameter names are passed. LINE_OFFSET encodes that
// gap in one place rather than as a magic number wherever a stack is parsed.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DESIGN DECISIONS worth a reviewer's eye (kept here rather than only in a
// chat message, so the next person to touch this file finds the reasoning
// beside the code it explains):
//
// 1. RunOptions.values patches the doc AFTER the script runs its own literal
//    defaults, rather than threading overrides back into param() so a drag
//    could change which branch of an `if` executes. The spec's "a slider
//    drag re-runs the script with the new value" reads as the more powerful,
//    control-flow-aware version; this file ships the simpler one. Revisit if
//    a lesson actually wants a param to gate which STEPS exist, not just
//    their numbers.
// 2. cone() takes two arguments (across, tall), not the spec's three --
//    ConeFeature has no field for a flat top radius. See cone()'s own
//    comment.
// 3. holes()'s `apart` is read as full corner-to-corner spacing and halved
//    into HoleFeature.corners' dx/dy (which the doc already defines as
//    half-spacings) -- not passed through directly.
// 4. sk.round()/sk.chamfer() are not in the spec's Language section. Without
//    them, a sketch with a rounded or chamfered corner (which SketchFeature
//    already supports, and the Rules panel already exposes) has no way to
//    reach that state from a script at all -- so this file adds the two
//    names rather than leave a real Build-mode capability unreachable from
//    Code. Flagged as an addition, not a spec deviation.
// 5. draft()'s {from} word is turned into a pull axis and a neutral value by
//    reading the target's own bounding box (see primitiveExtreme()) --
//    DraftFeature.neutral has no generatedParams() slider today, so nothing
//    else in the app derives it this way yet. A {neutral: N} escape hatch is
//    added alongside {from} so any doc (not only ones whose neutral sits
//    exactly on a bounding-box extreme) still round-trips through toScript().
// 6. A param() bound to MORE than one doc slot (`const s = param('s', 20);
//    box(s, s, s)`) still gets one Dimensions-panel row PER SLOT (three, for
//    that example), each independently draggable -- dragging one does not
//    move the other two, even though toScript(doc, namedParams) will
//    correctly regenerate all three as `s` on Code -> Build -> Code. A
//    single slider driving every bound slot at once would need the PANEL
//    (components/ReshapePreview.tsx / ReshapeParamsPanel.tsx), not this
//    file, to collapse NamedParamDef.slots into one row -- out of scope for
//    the fixes this note was added alongside (2026-09-04).
