// OpenCascade solid -> THREE.BufferGeometry. three.js's half of the same gap
// lib/occt-mesh.ts closes for the JSCAD/regl renderer -- see that file for the
// full account of why a B-rep has no triangles in it at all until something
// meshes it.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN A SECOND RETURN SHAPE BOLTED ONTO
// tessellate(). The two callers want genuinely different data. The JSCAD/regl
// path wants a `geom3` -- flat, ungrouped, three fresh vertices per triangle --
// because that is the format @jscad/modeling and the regl renderer already
// speak. three.js wants an INDEXED BufferGeometry: shared vertices, a
// `position` attribute, an `index`, and (new here) a record of which index
// range came from which face, so a future Raycaster hit can be resolved back
// to a TopoDS_Face. Neither caller's shape is a strict subset of the other's,
// so this mirrors tessellate() rather than wrapping it.
//
// THE SAME TWO TRAPS, because they are properties of OpenCascade's
// triangulation API, not of the JSCAD-shaped output that used to hide them:
//
//   THE LOCATION. A face's TopLoc_Location must be applied to every node
//   before it goes in the position buffer, or repeated geometry (every
//   instance of a patterned hole, say) stacks up at the origin.
//
//   THE ORIENTATION. A REVERSED face's triangles are wound for the surface,
//   not for the solid, and must have their winding flipped or that face is
//   inside-out. signedVolume() below is the same sanity check occt-mesh.ts
//   runs, ported to read an indexed buffer instead of a polygon list.
//
// THIS FILE DOES NOT IMPORT 'three' AT RUNTIME. Only `import type` -- erased
// at compile time -- so that pulling in this module never pulls three.js into
// a page's bundle. The caller loads three itself (dynamically, so it code-
// splits) and hands the live module in as `THREE`; see
// components/model/BrepViewportThree.tsx.
