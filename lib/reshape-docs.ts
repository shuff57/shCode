// In-app reSHape Script reference — hand-authored for the Build toolbar DSL
// surface the reSHape script runner executes. Every code example runs in the
// docs sandbox and is tested against scripts/test-reshape-script.mjs to verify
// it produces valid geometry. Nothing loads from a CDN.
//
// The runner loads the B-rep kernel and the script runner in a sandboxed iframe,
// so all names in scope are part of the reSHape script vocabulary: box, cylinder,
// sphere, cone, ring, hole, holes, hollow, round, bevel, repeat, repeatAround,
// mirror, move, turn, join, cut, keep, sketch, pull, spin, blend, param.
//
// Scope-out (stated explicitly so a future maintainer doesn't rediscover
// the boundary). Every section is the taught surface for the Build UI. The
// reference mirrors the Build toolbar one-to-one: each section teaches one
// tool and the operations you can chain from it. Coverage means every call
// in the script DSL contract appears in at least two examples, and every
// refusal the kernel produces has example text quoting it. Examples are
// executed top-to-bottom; the last shape built is what shows.
//
// Note: the docs sandbox has no parameter panel — param() examples run with
// the default value. The live Dimensions panel is part of the Build workspace.
