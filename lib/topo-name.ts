// Stable names for faces and edges, so a student's selection survives a rebuild.
//
// THE PROBLEM. A B-rep kernel gives you ADDRESSABLE faces. It does not give you
// PERSISTENT ones. Change an upstream dimension, the kernel rebuilds, and you
// get a fresh shape whose faces are in a fresh order. "Face 3" is not
// necessarily the face the student clicked. Every parametric CAD system has to
// solve this and it is the one FreeCAD lived with as its most notorious defect
// for over a decade. Adopting a kernel is the easy half; this file is the hard
// half.
//
// THE IDEA. A name is not a position in the result. It is a path through the
// history that PRODUCED the result. shCode has an unusual advantage here:
// ModelDoc is already an ordered list of features with stable string ids, which
// is exactly the substrate a naming scheme needs and what most CAD systems have
// to retrofit. Every face in the final solid has a first cause somewhere in
// that list, and the name is that cause written down.
//
//   e1.side[sk1.edge0]     the side face extrude e1 swept from sketch edge 0
//   e1.cap[top]            the face capping the top of that extrude
//   b1.face[+z]            the top face of box b1
//   op1.split[b1.face[+z], near(12.5,4)]
//                          a piece of that box face, cut into several by op1
//
// Read the last one carefully, because it is where the difficulty actually
// lives. A boolean does not merely keep or drop faces: it SPLITS them. One face
// goes in and three come out, and which of the three the student meant cannot
// be answered by the history alone -- the history says "all three came from
// b1.face[+z]". Something has to distinguish them.
//
// WHAT DISTINGUISHES A SPLIT PIECE. Not an ordinal. `split[..., 0]` is exactly
// the index-based naming this file exists to avoid: change an upstream number,
// the pieces come back in a different order, and the fillet jumps to a
// different piece of the same face. Instead a piece carries a geometric
// discriminator -- a point known to lie on it -- expressed in the PARENT
// face's own parameter space so it moves with the parent rather than with the
// world. On a rebuild the pieces are re-derived and the one containing that
// point wins.
//
// That is a heuristic and it is worth being honest about its failure mode: if
// a change is large enough that no piece contains the old point, the name does
// not resolve. That is a real limit, and the answer to it is not to guess. See
// the note on unresolvable names at the bottom.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT. There is no kernel here. This is the algebra of names
// -- their shape, how they are written down, how they are read back, and what
// each feature kind is entitled to name. Resolution against real geometry is
// the next piece and it needs OpenCascade's Modified/Generated history maps.
// Keeping the two apart means the naming rules can be tested against
// arithmetic, the way lib/least-squares.ts is, rather than only against a
// running kernel.
