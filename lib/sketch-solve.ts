// Constraints on a sketch outline, and the solver that honours them.
//
// The constraints a straight-edged polygon can express: an edge held
// horizontal or vertical, an edge held at a length, two edges held equal, a
// corner pinned. That is most of what a first sketch needs, and all of it is
// reachable without arcs.
//
// The method is least squares over the residuals, not relaxation.
//
// It used to be relaxation: ask each rule in turn to nudge its own corners
// the smallest distance that would satisfy it, and repeat until nothing
// moves. That is a handful of lines and it works for straight edges, but it
// cannot express tangency at all -- there is no direction to nudge a line
// that makes it "closer to tangent" one rule at a time -- and this file said
// so, naming planegcs as the moment that arrived. Arcs arrived in the
// 2026-09-01 bow work, so it did.
//
// What replaced it is ours rather than vendored, for three reasons measured
// at the time: planegcs is a 600 KB LGPL wasm blob in a bundle that is
// otherwise MIT, its wrapper initialises asynchronously while this function
// is called synchronously from React render paths and from a sync test
// harness, and residualsOf() below already computed the hard half -- one
// number per rule, all in distance units, which IS the residual vector a
// least-squares solver needs.
//
// So: every rule is written as "how wrong is this", and lib/least-squares.ts
// moves the corners until all of those are as close to zero as they can get,
// all at once. Adding a rule means writing what wrong means for it and
// nothing else -- no derivative by hand, no new solver. It still degrades
// sensibly when rules disagree, because a least-squares answer to a
// contradiction IS the compromise, and it still stays fast because a sketch
// has a dozen corners rather than a thousand.

 * setting -- it is "whichever OLDER rule is in the way, gone".
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-04: cycling "Edges 1 and 2" to equal after both edges
 * already carried fixed, different lengths (40 and 20) landed the sketch in
 * "these rules cannot all be true", garbled numbers, red banner -- for a
 * rule the student had just asked for on purpose. Solved and judged from
 * seedForNewRule()'s seed rather than the raw points, so a between-edges
 * rule gets the same fewest-movers attempt ModelEditor's own gate does --
 * settling should not have to fight a collapse the seed would have avoided.
 *
 * "Unsatisfiable" now means the geometric gate too (collapsedByRatio), not
 * only overConstrained: a between-edges rule can satisfy every residual by
 * collapsing the shape to a sliver (S09, 2026-09-04), which is exactly the
 * case this function exists to route around, not to wave through because
 * the numbers came back clean.
 *
 * Tries removing each older rule in turn -- never the one just added -- and
 * keeps the single removal that resolves it AND keeps the most of the
 * sketch's own area. Array order (oldest first) alone is not enough: S11
 * (2026-09-04) had two older rules that would each individually resolve the
 * conflict on their own, and the older of the two was the wrong one to drop
 * -- it left the sketch's UNTOUCHED bottom edge tilted, where dropping the
 * other left the edge the student was actually working on tilted instead,
 * and kept 38% of the sketch's area against the older removal's 28%. A
 * conflict that needs more than one rule gone is left alone, banner
 * included: this is a nudge for the ordinary "these two just started
 * disagreeing" case, not a general re-solver for every possible
 * contradiction (three different lengths pinned to one edge, for instance,
 * never resolves by dropping any single one of them, and must not pretend
 * to by cascading through a second removal).
