// Turning a TopoName back into an actual face on a built shape.
//
// lib/topo-name.ts decides what a name IS -- a path through the history that
// produced the face, rather than a position in the result. This is the other
// half: given such a name and a freshly built shape, find the face it means.
//
// The claim being tested is narrow and is the whole point of the exercise:
//
//     build -> change an upstream number -> rebuild -> the name still finds
//     the same face
//
// If that holds, a student can fillet an edge and keep the fillet when they
// widen the part. If it does not, parametric modelling does not work, and no
// amount of kernel makes up for it.
//
// WHAT IS HERE AND WHAT IS NOT. `primitive` names -- the faces of a box,
// cylinder, sphere, cone or torus -- resolve from the shape alone, with no
// operation history needed. `carried` and `split` names, the ones that ride
// through a boolean, resolve through the operation history that buildDoc now
// keeps alive; lib/topo-history.ts is the layer that asks the kernel and this
// file is the bookkeeping on top of it.
//
// `swept`, `rounded` and `cap` resolve through the sweep history buildDoc keeps
// alongside the boolean history -- a prism or revolve GENERATES one wall per
// profile edge and a cap at each end, which is an exact answer rather than a
// discriminated one.
//
// `made` still returns null, and it is worth saying why rather than listing it
// as missing: the faces a cut appears to invent -- the floor and walls of a
// groove -- are not invented at all, they are the TOOL'S faces carried through.
// So they are already nameable with the machinery here, off the tool feature's
// id, and `made` may turn out to be needed only for the seams a fuse genuinely
// creates. That is a design question, not a gap, and it is left open rather
// than guessed at.

 *
 * THE FIX RUNS resolveNameAsUsedBy() BACKWARDS, AS A SEARCH. That function
 * already knows how to push a stored primitive-face name FORWARD across
 * however many recorded operations sit between where it was written and
 * where it is used -- moves, booleans, whatever `ops` holds; it is what a
 * FilletFeature itself resolves against when it rebuilds (see
 * lib/occt-build.ts's 'fillet' branch). Naming a click is the same problem
 * read the other way: try every primitive this document could mean, push
 * each of its candidate face names forward to `pickedFeature`, and keep
 * whichever one lands on the exact face that was clicked. Bounded and
 * cheap -- at most (primitive count) x (3-6 faces per primitive)
 * resolutions, never a search over the model's whole geometry.
 *
 * NARROW ON PURPOSE, the same discipline nameEdgeBetweenPrimitiveFaces()
 * already follows. A face with no recorded path back to any primitive --
 * the new wall a Hole drills, the reflected half of a Mirror (only its
 * fuse is recorded as an op, not the reflecting transform that made the
 * second half -- see that branch's own comment), the seam where two
 * different primitives actually meet in a Combine -- returns null here
 * rather than a guess. That is the same refusal resolveName() already gives
 * for a `made` name: no answer is better than a confident wrong one.
