// OpenCascade solid -> triangles the existing renderer can draw.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. lib/occt-build.ts turns a ModelDoc into a B-rep solid and
// has been measured against the oracle for a week; nothing could DRAW one. A
// B-rep stores surfaces and the curves that trim them -- there are no triangles
// in it, and a GPU draws nothing else. So every previous slice ended at a volume
// number, which is why the whole conversion was still invisible to a student.
//
// WHAT IT HANDS BACK, and why that shape. A plain JSCAD `geom3`:
// `{ polygons: [{ vertices: [[x,y,z] x3] }], transforms }`. Not a new format --
// the SAME object @jscad/modeling produces, so public/reshape/runner.html's
// regl renderer draws an OpenCascade solid with no change to the renderer, the
// runner, or the preview component. The alternative was a second renderer
// beside the first, which would have made the swap an all-or-nothing cutover
// instead of something one lesson can try.
//
// DEFLECTION IS THE DIAL, and it is the same question the hull recipe is parked
// on: how finely to sample a curved surface. It is the accuracy/speed trade for
// every student on every preview, so it is a NAMED parameter with a measured
// default rather than a number buried in a call.
//
// Measured 2026-09-02, cylinder r12 h30, exact volume 13571.6803, angular held
// at the 0.3 rad default:
//
//   deflection   triangles   volume        error
//   1            164         13521.1144    0.3726%
//   0.5          164         13521.1144    0.3726%
//   0.1          164         13521.1144    0.3726%
//   0.05         192         13534.5188    0.2738%
//   0.02         304         13556.6240    0.1109%
//   0.005        612         13567.9153    0.0277%
//
// THE TOP THREE ROWS ARE IDENTICAL, and that is the part worth knowing. Not a
// measurement error and not a cache: below about 0.1 on a shape this size the
// LINEAR tolerance stops being the binding constraint, because the 0.3 rad
// angular one is already tighter. Turning `deflection` down past that point buys
// nothing at all -- the dial that still moves is `angular`. Anyone tuning this
// for quality who only reaches for the obvious parameter will conclude the
// mesher is ignoring them, and will be half right.
//
// JSCAD's 32-segment cylinder measures 13484.64, 0.64% low. So the LOOSEST
// setting here is already better than what ships today, and the 0.05 default is
// better again at 192 triangles -- a fifth of a JSCAD sphere's cost. A box, being
// flat, comes out at exactly 12 triangles and exactly 1000 at every deflection,
// which is the control proving the dial only spends triangles on curvature.
//
// TWO TRAPS, both silent, both measured rather than reasoned about:
//
//   THE LOCATION. A face carries a TopLoc_Location -- OpenCascade shares one
//   triangulation between repeated geometry and stores where each copy sits. Read
//   the nodes without applying it and every instance stacks up at the origin.
//   Ignoring it is invisible on a single primitive and wrong the moment anything
//   is moved, which is the worst possible failure order.
//
//   THE ORIENTATION. A face's triangles are wound for the SURFACE, not for the
//   solid. Where the face is REVERSED -- and on a plain box, half of them are --
//   the winding has to be flipped or the solid is inside-out on those faces. This
//   does not throw and often does not even look wrong; it shows up as backface
//   culling eating half the model, or as a signed volume that comes out negative.
//   The suite measures the SIGNED volume for exactly that reason.
