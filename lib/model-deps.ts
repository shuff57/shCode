// What an edit costs, before it is made.
//
// A ModelDoc is a list of features that refer to each other by id: a Pull names
// the sketch it came from, a Hole names the solid it drills, a Cut names both
// its inputs. Those references are the document's selections, and this file is
// about not letting one dangle.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, measured 2026-09-01. Deleting a sketch removed
// only the sketch. dependsOn() in lib/model-types.ts already knew every kind
// that names a target -- reordering the timeline used it -- but the delete path
// filtered combines and nothing else, so a Pull built from the deleted sketch
// stayed in the timeline pointing at nothing. What the student got was this,
// emitted straight into the preview:
//
//   const pull1 = extrudeOnPlane(sk1, p.pull1_height, 'xy', p.sk1_offset)
//                                ^^^                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
//
// `sk1` is not declared, so the model stopped rendering with
// "ReferenceError: sk1 is not defined". A raw JavaScript error, for an action
// that is not a mistake -- deleting a sketch is a perfectly ordinary thing to
// do. The student has no way to connect that sentence to what they just
// clicked.
//
// THE CONTRACT, which is the repo's already: say what an edit costs, in words,
// and let the caller decide. whyCannotRoundCorner() and
// whyRemovingCornerCosts() in lib/sketch-arc.ts are the same shape, and
// whyNameLost() in lib/topo-name.ts is the face-level version of the same idea.
// Nothing here refuses anything or edits anything on its own.
//
// NO KERNEL, ON PURPOSE. Whether a reference can still be honoured is a
// question about the document, not about geometry, so it is answerable while
// designing and testable without OpenCascade -- the same reason lib/topo-name.ts
// is split from lib/topo-resolve.ts.

 * the sketch takes all four, and it has to be computed rather than assumed:
 * checking one level deep leaves the Hole pointing at a Pull that is also gone.
 *
 * Run to a fixed point rather than in one forward pass. A doc loaded from disk
 * is not guaranteed to be in dependency order -- the timeline enforces that on
 * reorder, but nothing enforces it on load -- and a single pass over an
 * out-of-order doc would miss the features it had already walked past.
