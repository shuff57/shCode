// Levenberg-Marquardt: find the inputs that make a list of residuals smallest.
//
// This is the numerics half of the sketch solver, kept apart from it on
// purpose. Nothing in here knows what a corner or a constraint is -- it is
// handed a function from numbers to residuals and asked to make them small, so
// it can be tested on problems whose right answer is known from arithmetic
// rather than from a sketch.
//
// Why least squares at all: a sketch's rules are equations that all have to
// hold at once, and a residual is how far one of them is from holding.
// Relaxation nudges each rule in turn and repeats -- fine for straight edges,
// and unable to express tangency at all, because there is no direction to nudge
// a line that brings it "closer to tangent" one rule at a time. Solving the
// whole system instead means a rule only has to be WRITABLE as a residual, and
// tangency is easy to write.
//
// The method, in one paragraph. At a guess x, the residuals are r(x) and the
// Jacobian J is how each residual moves when each input is nudged. A plain
// Gauss-Newton step solves (J'J) d = -J'r and takes it, which is fast near the
// answer and wild far from it. Levenberg-Marquardt adds a damping term to the
// diagonal: (J'J + lambda*diag(J'J)) d = -J'r. Large lambda makes the step
// small and downhill (safe, slow); small lambda makes it Gauss-Newton (fast,
// bold). Every accepted step shrinks lambda, every rejected one grows it, so
// the method walks carefully where it must and quickly where it can.
//
// The Jacobian is computed by finite differences rather than derived by hand.
// That is a deliberate trade: a hand-written derivative per constraint kind is
// faster and is one more thing to get quietly wrong, and a sketch here has a
// dozen corners, not a thousand. Adding a constraint kind should mean writing
// what "wrong" means for it and nothing else.
