// In-app reSHape Script reference — hand-authored for the Build toolbar DSL
// surface the reSHape script runner executes. Every code example runs in the
// docs sandbox and is tested against scripts/test-reshape-script.mjs to verify
// it produces valid geometry. Nothing loads from a CDN.
//
// The runner loads the B-rep kernel and the script runner in a sandboxed iframe,
// so all names in scope are part of the reSHape script vocabulary: box, cylinder,
// sphere, cone, ring, hole, holes, hollow, round, bevel, repeat, repeatAround,
// mirror, move, turn, join, cut, keep, sketch, pull, spin, blend, param.
// Since SPEC-S2 the vocabulary ALSO carries the official geometry names as
// aliases of the same functions — cuboid, torus, fillet, chamfer, shell,
// subtract, union, intersect, linearPattern, polarPattern, extrude, revolve,
// loft — but the lesson pages below still teach the course words; teaching
// copy migration is a later, deliberate pass, not part of that spec.
//
// Scope-out (stated explicitly so a future maintainer doesn't rediscover
// the boundary). Every section is the taught surface for the Build UI. The
// reference mirrors the Build toolbar one-to-one: each section teaches one
// tool and the operations you can chain from it. Coverage means every call
// in the script DSL contract appears in at least two examples, and every
// refusal the kernel produces has example text quoting it. Examples are
// executed top-to-bottom; the last shape built is what shows.
//
// Note: the docs sandbox has no parameter panel — param() examples run with
// the default value. The live Dimensions panel is part of the Build workspace.

A 'cw' arc runs from a down in angle to b, so to sweep the outer side of a slot's rounded end the arc must START at its lower point and END at its upper one. Start at the wrong end and the arc sweeps the near side and bites a notch out of the slot instead of rounding it. Switching the sense to 'ccw' to cure that draws the right curve but leaves the arc running against the line it should meet smoothly, and the tangent rule then stops the sketch with "meet in a point rather than running smoothly; reverse one of them". The fix is to reverse the ends, not the sense.

The sketch faces u x v, and extrude pushes along that direction. A frame of u = [1, 0, 0], v = [0, 1, 0] at the origin is the same plane as sketch('top'), so that part is a 30 x 20 x 10 = 6000 mm^3 shape spanning z from 0 to 10.

Deleting a plane also deletes every sketch on it and everything built from those sketches, and the delete tells you so first. A script that writes plane() reads back with the plane first and sketch(pl1) after it. Naming the plane once is handy when two sketches share it.
