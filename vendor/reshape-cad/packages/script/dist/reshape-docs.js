// In-app reSHape Script reference — hand-authored for the Build toolbar DSL
// surface the reSHape script runner executes. Every code example runs in the
// docs sandbox and is tested against scripts/test-reshape-script.mjs to verify
// it produces valid geometry. Nothing loads from a CDN.
//
// The runner loads the B-rep kernel and the script runner in a sandboxed iframe,
// so all names in scope are part of the reSHape script vocabulary: box, cylinder,
// sphere, cone, ring, hole, holes, hollow, round, bevel, repeat, repeatAround,
// mirror, move, turn, join, cut, keep, sketch, pull, spin, blend, param.
// Since SPEC-S2 the vocabulary ALSO carries the official geometry names as
// aliases of the same functions — cuboid, torus, fillet, chamfer, shell,
// subtract, union, intersect, linearPattern, polarPattern, extrude, revolve,
// loft — but the lesson pages below still teach the course words; teaching
// copy migration is a later, deliberate pass, not part of that spec.
//
// Scope-out (stated explicitly so a future maintainer doesn't rediscover
// the boundary). Every section is the taught surface for the Build UI. The
// reference mirrors the Build toolbar one-to-one: each section teaches one
// tool and the operations you can chain from it. Coverage means every call
// in the script DSL contract appears in at least two examples, and every
// refusal the kernel produces has example text quoting it. Examples are
// executed top-to-bottom; the last shape built is what shows.
//
// Note: the docs sandbox has no parameter panel — param() examples run with
// the default value. The live Dimensions panel is part of the Build workspace.

A through-hole needs to know how thick the part is, and it does for boxes, cylinders, cones, prisms, spheres, tori and wedges you have not turned, for a box, cylinder, cone or torus you have turned (at any angle), for a polarPattern around the hole's own axis, for a polarPattern of a box, cylinder, sphere, cone, torus or prism around another axis, and for shapes pulled from a flat sketch, joined together, repeated in a line, moved or cut: a 30 x 20 pulled shape 20 mm tall takes hole(t, { across: 6 }) straight through and leaves 12000 - 180 x pi = 11434.51 mm^3. A hole that stops short (deep:) also has to know exactly where the top is, so it works on those but stops with "cannot find where the top of this ... is" on a cut shape. A turned wedge, a polarPattern of a wedge or of anything derived around another axis, an overlap or a mirror drilled along its own mirror axis still stops with "cannot find how thick" and asks you to give it a depth: (and a deep: you give such a shape drills from its middle, so the kernel refuses one that would leave a sealed cavity). holes() works the same way. A second hole may cross the first at right angles, through its axis, as long as it is narrower than the first: a 40 x 40 x 20 block with an 8 mm hole down through it and a 4 mm hole across it along x leaves 30589.32 mm^3 (9 faces).

They go inside counterbore: { across, deep } and countersink: { across, angle }, and a hole takes one or the other -- one mouth, one shape. In both, across is the RECESS's width, not the bore's, and the recess is cut from the mouth inward, so deep is measured from the same face as the bore. countersink's angle is the INCLUDED cone angle, so 90 is the widest and usual. A recess that cannot fit -- wider than its bore, or deeper than it -- is turned down by the kernel rather than by the script, because that is a question about geometry rather than about what you typed.`,

The name is not case-sensitive, so 'm6' works. size is just another way to say across, so give one or the other, never both: asking for both stops the script, and so does a size that is not in the list, with the valid names in the message. It works with a counterbore or a countersink, and holes() takes it too. Reload the script and toScript shows the resolved width, hole(b, { across: 6.6 }), not the name. Here an M6 hole goes through a 40 x 40 x 20 block: 32000 - pi x 3.3^2 x 20 = 32000 - 217.8 x pi = 31315.76 mm^3.

Or hollow it and then drill it: shell(b, { wall: 2 }) on a plain box leaves 40 x 40 x 20 - 36 x 36 x 16 = 11264 mm^3, and drilling it afterwards goes through both 2 mm walls: 11264 - 36 x pi = 11150.90 mm^3 (14 faces). Or drill it and then hollow it, when the hole goes straight through: the wall runs round the hole, 2 mm thick like everywhere else, so a 40 x 40 x 20 block with an 8 mm hole and then shell(b, { wall: 2, open: 'bottom' }) leaves 8672 + pi x (6^2 - 4^2) x 18 - pi x 4^2 x 2 = 9702.44 mm^3 (14 faces), and the closed hollow of the same block leaves 30994.69 - (36 x 36 x 16 - pi x 6^2 x 16) = 12068.25 mm^3.

A chamfer and a hole build in either order, and so do a blind hole and a round: the same block with the 8 mm hole and a 3 mm chamfer on one 40 mm edge leaves 32000 - 16 x pi x 20 - 1/2 x 3^2 x 40 = 30814.69 mm^3 (8 faces).

The words top and right match the outside edges around an inside corner as well, so the part answers with the sentence "3 edges of the part lie between a top face and a right face" until the words pick out exactly one edge.

A 'cw' arc runs from a down in angle to b, so to sweep the outer side of a slot's rounded end the arc must START at its lower point and END at its upper one. Start at the wrong end and the arc sweeps the near side and bites a notch out of the slot instead of rounding it. Switching the sense to 'ccw' to cure that draws the right curve but leaves the arc running against the line it should meet smoothly, and the tangent rule then stops the sketch with "meet in a point rather than running smoothly; reverse one of them". The fix is to reverse the ends, not the sense.

Reload the script and toScript shows those geom([...]) and rules([...]) rows, not the word slot. Here the centres are 40 apart and the radius is 5, so the outline is a 40 x 10 rectangle plus two half-discs, area 400 + 25 x pi, and extruded 10 mm it is 4000 + 250 x pi = 4785.40 mm^3, the same part as the arcs page builds row by row.`,

The sketch faces u x v, and extrude pushes along that direction. A frame of u = [1, 0, 0], v = [0, 1, 0] at the origin is the same plane as sketch('top'), so that part is a 30 x 20 x 10 = 6000 mm^3 shape spanning z from 0 to 10. The example moves origin to [5, 6, 7], which moves the whole part with it and changes nothing else: still 6000 mm^3, now spanning x from -10 to 20, y from -4 to 16 and z from 7 to 17. Swapping u and v turns u x v round, so the part goes the other way (down, z from -10 to 0, and turned across) rather than being quietly mirrored back; if a part comes out on the wrong side, swap them. Reload the script and toScript writes the frame back, not a named plane.`,

Deleting a plane also deletes every sketch on it and everything built from those sketches, and the delete tells you so first. A script that writes plane() reads back with the plane first and sketch(pl1) after it. Naming the plane once is handy when two sketches share it. A plane is FROZEN: it is a place in space, not a face of anything, so it does not move when a box height param changes. The example sketches a 40 x 25 rectangle on the plane at z = 10 and pulls it 12, a 40 x 25 x 12 = 12000 mm^3 slab spanning z from 10 to 22.`,

Each is its own sketch on the SAME frozen plane, so the pair stays level with each other even if you later change the size of either one. The plane is one timeline step, and a named plane's height can be a param(), so one slider lifts both sketches. The slab is 20 x 10 x 6 = 1200 mm^3 and the post is pi x 2.5^2 x 6 = 37.5 pi mm^3, so the joined part is 1200 + 37.5 pi = 1317.81 mm^3 and spans z from 10 to 16.`,

Say the sketch first, then the shape it cuts, then how deep. The sketch has to sit ON the face you cut from, because the cut runs from the sketch plane down into the shape. sketch('top') alone is the plane through the middle of a shape centred on the origin, so a pocket there would be a sealed cavity inside the part, not a pocket. The second argument of sketch() is how far the plane is moved from that middle: a 20 mm tall box centred on the origin has its top face at z = +10, so sketch('top', 10) puts the sketch on it. Here a 10 x 10 pocket 5 mm deep opens on the top face and leaves 40 x 40 x 20 - 10 x 10 x 5 = 31500 mm^3 (11 faces: the 6 of the box, 4 pocket walls and a floor).

A sketch gets the same checks as a pull: edges that cross, a corner landing on an edge, a spike, or no area at all stop with a sentence that says what to move. A spin also stops when the outline crosses the axis, because the two sides would overlap; draw the whole outline on one side. A shape touching the axis is fine.`,

A chamfer there would take off a different amount (74074.57 mm^3), so the two are not interchangeable. An outline drawn with arcs spins the same way when it sits clear of the axis. Rounds and arcs spin a full turn (360) only; a part turn of a curved outline, an arc whose centre is on the axis (a ball: use sphere()), and a groove with a curved outline each stop with a sentence.`,

This kernel builds a groove whose profile touches the axis (a solid disc, not a ring) and runs past a face, with a full 360 degree turn; a ring-shaped (annular) groove, and a partial turn, are not supported yet. Here the 6 x 8 profile spans radius 0 to 6 from the axis and height 14 to 22, and the 40 x 40 x 20 block ends at y = +20, so the profile pokes 2 mm out of that face. A full turn removes a cylinder of radius 6 and length 6 (the part inside the block, from y = 14 to 20): pi x 6^2 x 6 = 216 x pi mm^3 from the 32000 mm^3 block, leaving 31321.42 mm^3.
