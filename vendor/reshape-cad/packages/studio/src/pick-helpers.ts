// Pure projection-selection math for viewport picking (SPEC-mouse-parity.md

// already does for edges; this is only the "given already-projected
// candidates, which one wins" decision, kept here so it is testable under
// node --test the same as camera-fit.ts.

 *  nearest real surface at the cursor (a candidate behind that surface
 *  loses even if it projects closer to the cursor). `maxDepth` of Infinity
 *  skips the occlusion check entirely -- the same "no face hit at the
 *  cursor to reject against" fallback the edge candidates already use when
 *  their own reference hit is absent. Returns null when nothing is in
 *  tolerance, or every in-tolerance candidate is occluded. A tie in
 *  `distPx` keeps whichever candidate the caller listed first. */
