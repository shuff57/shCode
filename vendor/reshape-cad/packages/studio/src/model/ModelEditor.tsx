// The mouse half of the JSCAD workspace: a toolbar of shapes and operations,
// and the ordered list of what they built.
//
// The list is the point. Each row is a statement, the order decides the result,
// and Cut 1 reading "Box 1 - Cylinder 1" is the same fact as
// booleans.subtract(box1, cyl1) in the generated file next to it.
//
// Toolbar grouping mirrors Onshape's Part Studio bar (fetched from
// cad.onshape.com/help — see .gauntlet/parity.json "chrome" entry): tools run
// create -> modify -> pattern/transform -> delete, separated by dividers, and
// a family with variants (five primitives, three booleans, fillet/chamfer,
// linear/circular pattern, move/copy) collapses into ONE button with a caret
// flyout whose face shows the last variant used, instead of one button per
// variant. Search tools (Onshape: alt+c) is the same idea here.
//
// Deliberately NOT copied: Onshape puts Undo/Redo at the far left and buries
// Delete mid-bar next to Transform. reSHape keeps Undo/Redo/Delete clustered at
// the end, as it already did before this pass — for a first CS course "the
// row at the end for fixing mistakes" is one easy-to-teach unit, and there is
// no reach-distance problem here worth optimizing away from that.
