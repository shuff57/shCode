// The three.js twin of components/model/BrepViewport.tsx -- same OpenCascade
// kernel, same ModelDoc, same props, a different renderer underneath. Built
// alongside the JSCAD/regl viewport rather than in place of it so the two can
// be measured side by side; see app/brep-three/page.tsx and
// app/brep-test/page.tsx, which run the identical hardcoded document.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. @jscad/regl-renderer is the last piece of JSCAD
// still in the B-rep path -- lib/occt-mesh.ts exists purely to translate an
// OpenCascade solid into JSCAD's own geom3 shape so that renderer can draw it.
// three.js replaces it, and unlocks two things regl cannot do structurally:
// Raycaster (clicking an addressable B-rep face or edge) and world->screen
// projection (dragging a dimension handle). Both are built now -- see
// projectAnchors() below for the second, ported from
// public/reshape/kernel/runner-brep.html's own implementation of the exact
// same protocol (`anchors`/`onAnchors` here stand in for that file's
// `reshape-set-anchors` / `reshape-anchors` postMessage pair -- same pixel
// contract, no iframe boundary to cross).
//
// PICKING, IN TWO HALVES. A hover or a click first resolves to a piece of
// three.js geometry (a triangle range for a face, one THREE.Line for an
// edge) -- that half is pure raycasting and lives entirely in this file. The
// SECOND half, turning that geometry back into a stable TopoName the model
// can keep after a rebuild, is deliberately NOT reinvented here: a face uses
// the FaceRange map tessellateToThree() already returns, and an edge uses
// nameEdgeOnCurrentShape() in lib/topo-resolve.ts, the same naming machinery
// a Fillet feature resolves against when it rebuilds -- run backwards, as a
// search, so it answers for an edge on a Move or a Hole's untouched faces
// too, not only a bare primitive. Picking and naming staying two different
// files is what lets naming be tested against arithmetic (see
// topo-resolve.ts's own header) rather than only through a live Raycaster.
//
// EDGE PICKING GEOMETRY IS NOT THE DRAWN SILHOUETTE. The EdgesGeometry lines
// drawGeoms() adds below are a display-only silhouette over the
// TESSELLATION, at a 25-degree normal threshold -- good-looking, and not the
// kernel's own topology (see EDGE_THRESHOLD_DEGREES). A pickable edge has to
// be a real TopoDS_Edge, discretised straight off the B-rep curve, so this
// keeps a SEPARATE, invisible set of THREE.Line objects (see
// lib/occt-three.ts's edgesToThree()) purely for Raycaster to hit -- and,
// alongside each one, a THIRD piece of geometry: a pre-built highlight TUBE
// (see edgeTubeGeometry()), because a THREE.Line's own width cannot be
// trusted to render as more than 1px. All three are built ONCE per edge in
// drawGeoms(); hovering and selecting only ever swap which shared material a
// tube wears and toggle `.visible` -- see setHoveredEdgeTube() /
// setSelectedEdgeTube() for why that used to be a real per-pointermove cost
// and no longer is.
//
// EXPORT. This component does not write files -- it hands out the built
// triangles as a plain MeshInput (lib/mesh-export.ts, see the onMesh prop)
// every time a rebuild finishes, and SandboxWorkspace.tsx owns the actual
// Export STL button and the blob-URL download. Keeping the write side out of
// here is deliberate: a renderer that also knows about STL/OBJ/3MF headers is
// a renderer that has stopped being one, and lib/mesh-export.ts is the
// existing, already-tested writer -- nothing here re-implements it.
//
// KERNEL LOADING is copied from BrepViewport.tsx, not imported from it -- that
// file is under a measurement freeze right now (see the task this component
// was written for) and this one needs its own module-level promises anyway,
// since the two components can be mounted on different pages in the same
// session. See BrepViewport.tsx for the long-form reasoning on why the kernel
// is loaded through a runtime-computed import rather than a static one, and
// why that load lives in a module-level (not component-level) promise.

    // 0x8be9fd, see GridHelper() a few lines up, before it moved), but

    // furniture, ~48 degrees clear either side) by spending the MAJOR one:
    // hover vs. SELECTED (0xff79c6, hue 326) dropped from 133 degrees to 48.

    // find in the competing tool and credited us for finding -- not a
    // criterion to trade against a polish note. Moving the grid's OWN colour
    // instead (see GridHelper() above) frees this hex back up without
    // spending anything: hover is once again ~133 degrees from selected,
