// Pure selection-state type/op model for SPEC-mouse-parity.md Phase 3 item 7
// ("unify selection state between viewport and ModelEditor... the riskiest
// refactor in the phase"). This is the DESIGN only -- a later task wires it
// into ReshapeStudio.tsx/ModelEditor.tsx; nothing here touches React or the
// DOM, so it is unit-testable under node --test the same as camera-fit.ts.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. Today selection is six separate useState calls in
// ReshapeStudio.tsx: `selected` (feature ids, mutated by ModelEditor's
// pick() at ModelEditor.tsx:1118-1125), `pickedEdge`/`pickedFace`/
// `pickedSize` (the single most-recent viewport pick, mutated only by
// onPick around ReshapeStudio.tsx:1223-1264), and `pickedEdges`/
// `pickedFaces` (a Shift-accumulated multi-pick, same onPick). Read back
// together at ReshapeStudio.tsx:517 (HandleOverlay's feature filter),
// :686-705 (the context bar's selectionLabel, ownerOf-filtered) and
// ModelEditor.tsx's chosen()/round()/hollow() (ownerOf-guarded against
// staleness -- see round()'s own regression comment at ModelEditor.tsx:724).
// `SelectionState` merges the three axes into one `items` list plus one
// `primary` slot; `featuresOf`/`primaryOf`/`ownerScoped` are the read shapes
// that replace `selected`/the pickedEdge-trio/the ownerOf-filtered reads
// above -- see each function's own comment for the exact line it stands in
// for.
//
// pick(id, additive) at ModelEditor.tsx:1118-1125 is exactly `replace`
// (additive=false, "selected = [id]") and `toggle` (additive=true,
// "selected.includes(id) ? filter it out : append it") below, generalised
// from bare feature ids to any SelectionItem; `toggleFeature` is the
// feature-only wrapper that IS pick()'s additive branch. Structural
// equality for an item with a TopoName reuses the same rule ReshapeStudio's
// own sameTopo() (ReshapeStudio.tsx:61-63) uses to dedupe a Shift-click
// multi-selection: JSON.stringify comparison, since TopoName is a plain
// serialisable object.
//
// DEVIATIONS FROM THE LITERAL SPEC SKETCH (reality won; see the design
// report for the full list):
//  - No `id?: string` field. Nothing in the real pick payloads (ViewportPick
//    in BrepViewportThree.tsx, PickName in model-selection.ts, or the bare
//    `selected: string[]`) carries an id independent of kind+target+name; a
//    feature-kind item already uses `target` as the feature id, so a
//    separate `id` would be redundant and could drift out of sync with it.
//  - No `faceIndex` field (ViewportPick's own -- a mesh re-highlight
//    shortcut, a rendering concern, not a selection-state one).
//  - `ownerScoped` takes `doc` as a second parameter. The pattern it
//    replaces (ReshapeStudio.tsx:686-687) calls `ownerOf(doc, item)`, and
//    `ownerOf` (model-selection.ts) needs `doc` to check whether a name's
//    root feature still exists -- there is no way to answer "which owner"
//    without it.
//  - `toggle`'s primary-on-remove rule ("the new last-remaining item, or
//    null") is a NEW rule this module defines, not a pre-existing behaviour
//    of pick() -- `selected` has no primary concept of its own to match.
//    It does NOT bit-for-bit match onPick's `pickedEdge`, which today is
//    unconditionally overwritten to whatever was just clicked
//    (ReshapeStudio.tsx:1235-1236) even when that same click is a
//    Shift-toggle-OFF in `pickedEdges` -- i.e. today, toggling an edge off
//    still leaves `pickedEdge` pointing at the just-removed edge until the
//    next click. A later refactor that wants that exact quirk preserved
//    cannot lean on this generic `toggle()` alone for the pickedEdge slot;
//    it would need to set `primary` from the raw pick separately from
//    updating multi-select membership.
