// 2026-10-01 (Track A slice A2, second half): giving an existing hole a recess.
//
// This is a PURE module on purpose. ModelEditor.tsx is a component with no test
// harness -- node --test can only grep its source text (see
// test/marking-menu.test.mjs:227, which says so and works around it). So the
// decision logic lives here, where it can be tested for real, and ModelEditor
// calls it as a thin arrow. That matches the studio's rule that pure modules stay
// pure so they are testable under node --test, and the ContextActions rule that
// each verb IS the same closure the ribbon button calls -- no second
// implementation of any verb.
//
// Slice A1 gave the language `counterbore: { across, deep }` and
// `countersink: { across, angle }`, and generatedParams (59d054b) made them
// visible and editable once they exist. What was missing is the way to CREATE
// one: a student working in the Build toolbar never types script, and the hole
// flyout's main action drills a NEW hole, so a "Counterbore" item there would
// fire on the wrong target. The precedent for a verb that mutates the already
// selected feature is `round` (ModelEditor.tsx:876), not the flyout.
/** Why this feature cannot take a recess, or null if it can. */

}
/** The starting numbers for `kind` on `hole`.
 *
 *  Defaults are chosen so the result BUILDS. A recess that is degenerate (wider
 *  than its bore, or deeper than it) is a kernel refusal by the split pinned in
 *  slice A1 -- not a clamp -- so a default that refuses would greet a student with
 *  an error for clicking a button. `across` doubles the bore, which is the
 *  convention every measured case in this project uses (d6 bore with a d12 recess,
 *  in the spec, in the parity fixtures and in the countersink spike).

    return { diameter: across, depth: Math.max(0.5, Math.min(6, hole.depth / 2)) };
}
/** `hole` with `kind` set. Applying the kind a hole already has REMOVES the
 *  recess rather than setting it again -- one click adds, the same click takes
 *  it back off, which is the usual behaviour for a detail button and is the only
 *  remove path the Build toolbar would otherwise have. Switching kind drops the
 *  other one, because the model says they are mutually exclusive and leaving both
 *  set would produce a doc the kernel refuses.
 *
 *  Every click moves something, so there is no no-op to skip.
