// SketchCanvas2D (SPEC-sketcher2 §7): the FreeCAD-style 2D sketcher over the
// kernel's warm sketch session. An SVG canvas -- every committed row drawn in
// soup coordinates, Y-up, with the flip to SVG's Y-down applied at write time
// (svgY = -y) exactly as the archived engine/play/sketch.js did.
//
// The component holds NO geometry state of its own beyond tool state: the rows
// live on the SketchFeature (geoms/rules), the solved coordinates live in the
// SketchSession2D parameter vector, and every edit is one onChange(doc) so the
// studio's undo records exactly one entry per gesture. Decision logic lives in
// sketch-canvas-core.ts (pure, test-proven); this file only calls it.
//
// VIEW STATE (SPEC-mouse-parity Phase 2 item 1, 2026-09-20). The fixed
// +/-100mm viewBox is gone: the canvas navigates a {cx, cy, pxPerMm}
// SketchView from sketch-view.ts -- wheel zooms to the cursor, the active
// mouse scheme's own PAN button drags, Fit / Shift+F frames the content --
// and the viewBox is DERIVED from that state plus the measured element
// size. Two consequences shape the rest of the file: SNAP_PX / HIT_PX are
// screen pixels, so every tolerance goes through screenPxToWorld(view) at
// the point of use, and anything drawn at a fixed SCREEN size (vertex dots,
// stroke widths, the grid step) is scaled by the current pxPerMm instead of
// being a world-unit literal.
//
// HOVER SNAP GLYPHS (SPEC-mouse-parity Phase 2 item 3, 2026-09-20). The snap
// under the cursor is drawn as a marker for its KIND -- square endpoint,
// triangle midpoint, crosshair centre, X intersection, diamond on-curve, dot
// grid -- so a midpoint reads differently from an intersection before the
// click lands. It rides the pointermove hover path that was already here; no
// frame loop was added for it.
//
// MARQUEE SELECT (SPEC-mouse-parity Phase 2 item 5, 2026-09-20). A select-tool
// press that lands on EMPTY space drags a band instead of an entity: dragged
// left-to-right it windows (fully inside only), right-to-left it crosses
// (touched counts), both decided by marquee-select.ts, the same pure module
// the 3D box select will use. The gesture is selection and nothing else --
// it calls setSel and never writeDoc, so it adds no undo entry at all.
//
// TOOL KEYS AND CURSORS (SPEC-mouse-parity Phase 2 item 6, 2026-09-20). One
// letter arms one tool (L R C A S T V, Fusion's own), D opens a dimension,
// and every one of them is deaf while a text field has focus. The armed tool
// also sets the canvas cursor, so which tool is live is readable without
// looking up at the ribbon. The Esc cascade above them is untouched.
//
// ON-CANVAS DIMENSIONS (SPEC-mouse-parity Phase 2 item 7, 2026-09-20). The
// Dim tool picks an entity, auto-detects what it asks for (a line wants the
// distance between its ends, a circle or an arc its radius, two picked points
// the distance between them -- autoDimension decides, not this file), trails a
// ghost label off the cursor, and drops the label where the second click
// lands. Every dimension the sketch carries is then a real <input> chip in an
// HTML overlay OVER the svg, not inside it: that is what makes Tab cycle
// between them for free (native focus order) and what keeps a pointerdown on
// a value box from reaching the canvas and cancelling the placement it is
// part of. A chip looks like a label at rest and like a box once focused.
// The ribbon's own Dim / R / diameter buttons are untouched -- they still open
// the ribbon-docked box on the current selection.
//
// CONSTRAINT GLYPHS (SPEC-mouse-parity Phase 2 item 8, 2026-09-20). Every row
// in `rules` is drawn where it applies: the six kinds carrying a `value` as
// the value chip above (the number IS the glyph), the other ten as an icon at
// a constant screen size. Hover highlights on the same pointermove path the
// snap glyphs ride, a click selects, Del removes -- one onChange, so one undo
// entry. A glyph swallows its own pointerdown and click, which is why
// clicking one never draws geometry underneath it.
