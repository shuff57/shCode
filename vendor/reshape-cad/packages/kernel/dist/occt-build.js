// ModelDoc -> OpenCascade shape. The adapter, and nothing else.
//
// This is the layer JSCAD occupies today, rewritten against a B-rep kernel. It
// is deliberately narrow: it takes a document and an initialised OCCT module
// and returns shapes. It does not generate source text, it does not touch the
// UI, and it knows nothing about naming -- that is lib/topo-name.ts and the
// piece after this one.
//
// WHY IT CAN BE MEASURED. Volume and bounding box come out of the kernel, so
// scripts/test-occt-adapter.mjs can build the same fixtures the JSCAD oracle
// holds and compare. The prediction recorded when the oracle learned the
// difference between tessellated and exact: every FLAT fixture should match to
// the digit, and every ROUND one should move toward its analytic volume by the
// gap the baseline already prints. A round fixture that does not move means
// this file is not really using the kernel; a flat one that moves is a defect.
//
// ON TYPING. The kernel's own .d.ts is 1.54 MB and is not vendored, so `Occt`
// below is a hand-written slice naming only what this file calls. That is a
// deliberate trade: a wrong name here fails loudly at the first call rather
// than silently, and the alternative is carrying a megabyte and a half of
// generated declarations for thirty functions.

 * read either field: it built the sharp primitive and stopped. `doc.features`
 * came back correctly updated, the geometry did not change, and nothing said
 * so -- a document field that looks right sitting next to a shape that is
 * simply wrong, with nothing on screen to notice, which is exactly the
 * failure lib/occt-api.ts's own KNOWN/refuseUnknown mechanism exists to
 * prevent for code mode and this file had no equivalent of for Build mode.
 *
 * NOT a second way to fillet a primitive: this mirrors roundedCuboid() in
 * lib/occt-api.ts exactly -- gather every edge, add them all to ONE
 * BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet (or _MakeChamfer for a chamfer), Build() once.
 *
 * MEASURED, not assumed, on the cylinder case: TopExp_Explorer returns each
 * edge once per FACE that borders it, so a cylinder's two rim circles come
 * back TWICE each and its own seam line (the vertical join where the curved
 * face's periodic parameterisation closes on itself, not a real corner)
 * twice more -- six entries for three real edges. Deduped by IsSame() before
 * anything is added. The seam line is left IN rather than filtered out: it
 * has no dihedral angle to round, and measured against the kernel directly,
 * handing it to either BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet or _MakeChamfer is a
 * harmless no-op, not an error -- filtering it out changed nothing but the
 * code's own complexity.
 *
 * BOTH styles build for BOTH primitives -- measured, not assumed, so there is
 * no "only one is buildable" case to refuse between fillet and chamfer here.
 * What DOES need a loud refusal is a radius the shape's edges cannot take
 * (BRepFilletAPI reports it two different ways, same as the single-edge
 * fillet() in lib/topo-history.ts): this throws rather than swallowing
 * either one into null, because null here would silently drop the WHOLE
 * primitive from the build, and a caught exception turned into null is
 * exactly the shape of the fillet-after-move defect fixed earlier this
 * session. lib/occt-build.ts's own callers (BrepViewport.tsx and
 * BrepViewportThree.tsx) already wrap buildDoc() in a try/catch that shows
 * e.message in the "Could not build this model" panel, so throwing here
