// sketch-arc re-exports its own `Point` (identical to sketch-solve's), so a
// flat `export *` here is ambiguous -- namespaced instead. Nothing currently
// imports this package via its bare `.` entry point (every consumer uses a
// subpath, e.g. '@shuff57/reshape-sketch/sketch-arc'); this barrel exists for
// completeness.
