# Adding Lessons

Add a new folder in this directory for each lesson. Each lesson folder should include:

- `lesson.json` with metadata, steps, and requirements
- any starter files like `index.html`, `style.css`, or `script.js`

On the next build the lessons are automatically discovered and shown on the home page.
